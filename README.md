<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Here is how you can use the script. Be cautious when using this script for because it iterates over every folder and sub-folder which might end up taking a lot more time even crash if the directory has too many files or sub folders espeacially be aware if your local machine is older.
